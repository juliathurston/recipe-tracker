# Project description: Recipe CRUD
A CRUD application allows a user to create, read, update or delete selected data. For this project, you will build the interface of a food recipe CRUD app. The interface won't use a database or an API to store the data; it will require you to use React's useState() hook.

For detailed instructions on how to complete this project, consult the Instructions document in the Qualified assessment interface.

## Learning objectives
This project is designed to test your ability to work with rendering and state management using React. Before taking on this project, you should be comfortable with the learning objectives listed below:

- Installing packages via NPM

- Running tests from the command line

- Writing React function components

- Using hooks like useState()

- Debugging React code through console output

## Project steps to complete
To complete this project, you must do the following:

- Write code that passes all the tests in the Qualified assessment in this lesson.

- Write code that passes all of the requirements outlined below, and submit your GitHub repo link in the next lesson.

Remember to sync this Qualified project with your local machine so that you can commit it to GitHub in the next lesson.

## Requirements to pass
For your project to pass, all of the following statements must be true. These criteria are reflected in the rubric in the next lesson.

- All tests are passing in Qualified.

- A user can create new recipes.

- A list of the existing recipes is displayed to the user.

- A user can delete a recipe.

- The app uses the useState() hook.

- Data is displayed in a table (such as the one provided in the starter code).

- The app looks like the provided mockup.

## Project feedback
Below you'll find some examples of feedback that you might receive on your project. They are presented to you here for learning purposes.

Remember, it's most important to meet the requirements listed above. But if you do any of the things listed here, you'll receive feedback that you've done exceptional work:

- Use of any pure functions.

- Use of any clear and informative variable or function names.

If you do any of the following, the Chegg Skills team may suggest improvements you can make. However, doing any of these won't cause you to fail the assessment or require that you produce revisions.

- Styling that doesn't resemble the provided mockup. Matching the exact design isn't required, but the styling should look similar to the provided mockup.

- Use of any non-pure functions that could be changed into pure functions.

- Use of any variable or function names that could be improved (such as highly abbreviated names).

- Use of components with multiple reasons to re-render.

- Use of components with multiple responsibilities. Most logic should be broken out into small, single-responsibility pure functions that mutate the state as necessary.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
